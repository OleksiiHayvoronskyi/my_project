			ABOUT explored USA Real Estate Dataset.
			=======================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------
### The dataset has 1 CSV file: 'realtor-data.csv'.

#### There are 10 columns in the file:
1) **status** (Housing status - a. ready for sale or b. ready to build);
2) **bed** (# of beds);
3) **bath** (# of bathrooms);
4) **acre_lot** (Property / Land size in acres);
5) **city** (city name);
6) **state** (state name);
7) **zip_code** (postal code of the area);
8) **house_size** (house area/size/living space in square feet)
9) **prev_sold_date** (Previously sold date);
10) **price** (Housing price).

*As I analysed this dataset, I tried to predict prices of real estate.
And I managed to do it*.

*My project consists of 6 conditional stages in which you will see 
different colorfull graphics, metrics, and tables with predicted values*.

I have used various **single algorithms** such as:
- ***Linear Regression***;
- ***Decision Tree Regressor***;
- ***Random Forest Regressor***;
- ***Gradient Boosting Regressor***,

and **ensembles of algorithms** such as:

- ***Stacking Regressor***;
- ***Bagging Regressor***;
- ***Ada Boost Regressor***;
- ***XGB Regressor***.

*I also have used **GridSearchCV** for finding 
the optimal parameters for some algorithms*.

*It will not difficult for everyone to understand my project.
There are comments near in of each of code string*.
